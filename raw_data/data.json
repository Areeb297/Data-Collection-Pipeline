A game changer.\",\"2\":\"I love this bag. It's been really well thought out, with a padded compartment for laptop or folders at the back. The lunch part of the bag can take up half the room in the bag or you can push it back in. I only have a small lunch so I barely use much of it, meaning there's plenty of space left in the main compartment. It's really good quality and feels much more expensive than it is. It has comfortable padded straps and an added zip pocket at the back on the outside, that would nicely fit a purse or phone. This bag is perfect for work and it's not too big looking. This was something I was concerned about when buying the bag. I'm a 5'6 female and it doesn't look massive on me at all.

I need 2 iPads for work purchases and with apple changing the leads I thought I would wait for the new 9th generation to come out so I could just use the new style charger for both iPads. Guess what they have changed the iPad 9th back to the original small lead with the small non usb plug end. So I have a charger for my iPad Air, charger for my 9th gen iPad and also a usb charger for my iPhone 12 (as I have usb sockets around the house) nightmare to be honest.\\n\\nAlso when I bought the iPad Air it is compatible with the Apple Pencil gen 2 so I bought this! Now I find out the newest iPad out is only compatible with the Apple Pencil gen 1 (I have yet to try it yet!!!) why would you think a newer model iPad would revert back to older pencil and charger??\\n\\nTo be honest apart from bigger storage on the 9th gen and slightly better quality camera it seems to be the exact same as the 8th gen one.\\n\\nSaying that it is nice buying something new, the excitement of getting something new for the first 5 minutes only to realise it is pretty much the exact same as a previous model but you know your going to get stung for different accessories, but hey we still buy them and they work pretty well.\\nRead more\",\"6\":\"I was forced to get a new keyboard when my old one finally gave up the ghost after one too many bits of toast \\/ sesame seed \\/ pistachio fell down between the keys.

Recently after receiving a VIP code for a PlayStation 5 I sold my PlayStation 4 and now on the latest gen.

I\\u2019ve copied some games to it and it\\u2019s still been fine and have been running PlayStation 4 games on it such as Wolfenstein Alt Collection, Tony Hawks Pro Skater 1 & 2, Serious Sam etc and has worked flawlessly.\\n\\nThis drive will also store your PlayStation 5 games on it but won\\u2019t be able to run them as it\\u2019s not a SSD so not compatible for that but for storage and being able to run those PlayStation 4 Disc and Digital games it\\u2019s still a top gem.\\n\\nAt the end of the day it\\u2019s an external hard drive and like any other 3.0 with a usb they will work for Playstation or Xbox. If they have their own format tool which they do you won\\u2019t have any problems. The first thing that comes up once you\\u2019ve connected it and powered on the console a message saying \\u201cNot Compatable\\u201d. Well it actually is it\\u2019s just that it\\u2019s not formatted and more like it\\u2019s been pre formatted to NTFS which is what windows use. Once you have formatted it, it takes literally seconds that\\u2019s it.\\n\\nOnce you go to your system settings scroll down to Devices, USB Storage Devices, External USB 3.0 Toshiba. There it will ask you to format to an extended storage.\\n\\nPlease note, once you have done this the preferred drive will be the external one, I\\u2019d suggest to use the internal hard drive for main storage as it will be more cooled from the fan inside the console.\\n\\nIf you have say The Last Of Us which is about 50GB move that over to the external drive as there isn\\u2019t anymore updates for that game now. While on the subject keep games like Red Dead Redemption 2 on the main drive I only say as with new games your going to get a lot of updates like still Grand Theft Auto 5 and running the external drive constantly with the updates ploughing at it every day or so wouldn\\u2019t be good for it.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t tried any of the games running off it yet but from what I read online they run faster apparently.\\n\\nI would recommend a 4TB hard drive as after the format with the systems own volume putting its own data on your left with about 3.5TB\\nRead more\",\"14\":\"We already own a Fire 7 (5th gen) and an iPad mini (2nd gen). Surprisingly enough, this Fire HD 8 was bought to replace the iPad. My kids prefer the Fire, and they fight over who gets to play it. The reason is simple: the iPad requires games to be bought individually from the App Store, and since popular games like the Toca Life series are \\u00a34 each, I have to limit the number of games they\\u2019re allowed.\\n\\nIn contrast, the Fire for Kids app allows them to browse and download anything they want, from a curated, age-appropriate selection, of games, video, books and Audible audiobooks. They like the fact that they can download without asking for permission. Meanwhile I can control things like screen-time limits or age filters from either the parental control screen on the device, or the Amazon Parent Dashboard webpage. It\\u2019s a safe walled garden. That\\u2019s the main selling point of this device. Everything else is nice-to-have, but ultimately irrelevant.\\n\\nStill reading? Here\\u2019s the nice-to-haves that make this Fire HD 8 better than the other Amazon tablets for me: Firstly, the faster processor does make a difference. Startup time and download time for apps is noticeably faster.\\n\\nThe 8-inch (1280 x 800) screen is a huge improvement versus the 7-inch (1024 x 600) one. It might not seem like much on paper, but it\\u2019s really noticeable when playing games and watching video. Due to the slightly more rectangular aspect ratio, the screen looks significantly bigger than our iPad mini (despite the difference in diagonal measurement being only 0.1 in). Presumably the 10-inch model would be better still, but I didn\\u2019t want anything that bulky.\\n\\nThe USB-C port is another nice-to-have. Our older Fire tablet uses Micro USB, and I still, after all these years, have to check the orientation to make sure I\\u2019m plugging it in the right way. Sure, it\\u2019s not a big deal, but it\\u2019s nice to get rid of this little annoyance.\\n\\nThe stand looks like a gimmick, but it\\u2019s already proven to be very handy. The angle is steeper than I expected (almost vertical, and can\\u2019t be adjusted), but it\\u2019s just right for watching video without having to prop it against something. As for its durability, all I can say is that I bought the Fire 7 with Kid-proof case when it first came out\\u2026 (checks notes) 5 years ago. It gets dropped pretty much every day, and it still survives. That\\u2019s pretty durable.\\n\\nYes, it\\u2019s not perfect. I\\u2019ve tried to use it as a \\u2018grown-up\\u2019 tablet, and I find the Fire OS rather too \\u2018locked-down\\u2019. The Amazon App store has a reasonable selection (including, surprisingly, apps like Skype and Zoom), but the lack of Google Play apps like Gmail and Google docs quickly becomes frustrating. But my kids have never needed any of that, and realistically, these devices weren\\u2019t made for \\u2018real work\\u2019.\\n\\nAnother thing to watch out for is that it needs a bit of setup out of the box. You need to connect to WiFi, enter your Amazon password, skip through a 2-minute intro video and set up a child account before it\\u2019s ready to use. Mine also required a software update right out of the box. All told, it only took about 10 minutes to set up, but it\\u2019s probably best to do this before handing it over to an excited child.\\n\\nThe only real downside is that this tablet is a bit more expensive than previous versions. That said, consider that the standalone Fire HD 8 without \\u201cSpecial Offers\\u201d (i.e. lockscreen ads) costs \\u00a399.99. You get 1 year of \\u201cFire for Kids Unlimited\\u201d subscription with the device, which usually costs \\u00a31.99\\/mo for Prime subscribers (\\u00a33.99\\/mo non-subscribers). This means that at current prices, I\\u2019m paying \\u00a316 for the kid-proof case and 2-year warranty, which is a pretty good deal as far as I\\u2019m concerned.\\nRead more\",\"15\":\"PRICE.

In our rear TV room the wifi strength from our home Orange Router was fair to sometimes good. The purpose I bought this for was to improve this wifi signal, and improve my TV streaming quality. So, the setup is not as straightforward as it seems, to cut a long story short, I used the internet to connect, and I set up a separate wifi account, with its own name, but using the same pass word as my home router. There are good Utube guides on how to do this, because I found the included instructions not accurate for the internet set up. So, everything was good, I positioned the extender between my own home router and the rear TV room, I had three wifi bars showing, and the app said it was in an optimal position. And then some good news, the wifi signal went from fair\\/good to very good in the rear room, I was happy. But, when I streamed my TV, it was buffering as much as before, and going off all together intermittently?? This didnt happen when connected to the home router. So, I decided to do a Speed Test, and found my router WiFi was pumping out 16Mb\\/s on wifi to the rear room, and the extender was down to 12Mb\\/s,?? so I tried changing the servers, and also trying through my VPN link, still the same, 16 from home router, 12 from extender. So, this took me to the end of my expertise, and I would like to know why the extender cant at least boost the signal so it matches the router, and also why does the extender improve my wifi signal strength, but not the streaming speed? Ive sent it back, excellent service from Amazon as usual, but I still dont understand why it didnt improve my TV Streaming? So, in my case, didnt work. Ive still given three stars because it does boost the wifi signal, but didn't appear to improve my tv streaming, good response from vendor, appreciated. Further update, after receiving very detailed vendor support, ive changed my router wifi channels to new settings, and the extender streaming speed has increased from 12Mb\\/s to 15Mb\\/s, and is now matching my Orange Router in the marginal wifi zone in our rear bedroom, Happy. The lesson ive learnt is that, for the price, its an amazing product, but you have to perceiver with the set up and testing. And certainly contact the vendor with any issues.\\nRead more\",\"18\":\"I have honestly had \\u00a315 printers second hand that have been battered for years than this!

I was even happy with the fact that I'd be paying a small fee for a kids service after a year on top of the Prime membership. But what feels completely rubbish is that you can't watch Amazon Prime videos within the child's profile! Only stuff you've actually bought.\\nWithin the parent account controls on the main Amazon site is a tab to select options relating to Prime Video, but when you click this, it simply says \\\"We've added loads of great Prime content to Amazon Kids+, accessible from the app.\\\" Well, Amazon Prime doesn't have a great selection of kids films to start with, but as you work down the few decent quality films they do have, none are available within Amazon Kids+.\\n\\nGruffalo? Nope\\nHappy Feet? Nope\\nStickman? Nope\\nSpy Cat? Nope\\nDespicable Me? Nope\\nThe Nut Job? Nope\\nRoom on a Broom? Nope\\nShaun the Sheep Movie? Nope\\nThe Lorax? Nope\\nHotel Transylvania? Nope\\n\\nSo how do you actually get these on the tablet for your kids to watch? There are two ways. The first - buy them, even though you can already watch them with Amazon Prime. Yep - pay full price for a film you've been able to watch for free on your TV or all your other devices, purely for the luxury of accessing it within your kids profile on the tablet. Or, do what any sane person will do, and use the Prime Video app within the parent profile on the tablet. But obviously, you have to be with your kids because if they start messing around, scrolling and exiting the film you've chosen, they could see all Amazon Prime content, or make unauthorised purchases on your account.\\n\\nAmazon must know that this is what people will do - no one is going to buy a movie they can watch for free with a few swipes on the same device. And so it feels frankly cruel and immoral to create this choice: \\\"Pay us more money for the same movie, or risk your child's online safety!\\\"\\n\\nTo add insult to injury, there is a clever functionality that allows children to access the age appropriate store and \\\"request\\\" new content, which is then approved in the parental profile. But no Prime content shows up! So even if you wanted to pay for it, the children can't select a film, you'd have to buy it first within your main Amazon account. It's quite mindboggling that I type in \\\" The Gruffalo\\\" into the kids profile store search, and it simply doesn't show up - despite the fact it's free to watch on Prime Video.\\n\\nThey don't deliberately hide this limitation, but they don't exactly publicise it either. Over the years we've bought enough premium films to still have a reasonable selection for the children to watch, plus you can access both BBC iPlayer Kids and Netflix (which, for safety, you need to add profile locks to so that children can only access the kids profile - a bit of a chore but a reasonable workaround), so between the three services it doesn't feel quite so limiting.\\n\\nStill: Anyone would expect a Prime Video app within the kids profile that gives access to the full range of Prime Video kids content, given that we PAY FOR THIS ALREADY. It's really outrageous that Amazon don't offer this. And, it's a real shame because there's plenty to love about this tablet - feels solid, a no-quibble 2 year guarantee, a nice, well-designed protective case. But they really need to sort out whatever licensing issue is preventing them from giving this tablet the access it needs.\\nRead more\",\"25\":\"Bought this for my little one for out and about traveling.\\nSetting it up, we came to a subscription page.\\nApparently in order for this to work you HAVE to have a subscription.\\nIf you don't you cannot use the tablet.\\nIn order to use it you need to BUY apps\\/vids ect on the parent profile and then share them to the kids profile.\\nExcept if you are a prime member you cannot share your included prime content.

Rating it down from 5 star to 4 stars.\\n\\n** ORIGINAL REVIEW **\\n\\nReceived this drive today, thought I would provide some speed test results whilst I'm running SeaTools in the background, a long test which will take just under 20 hours for this 8TB drive!\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nI was looking to backup almost 4TB of photos from my NAS which is running out of space and needs an upgrade soon. I'm a hobbyist photographer fed up burning archival blurays in chunks of 25Gb and then having to use an outdated tool (Octopus DVD indexer) to catalogue which files are on which disks. I have a spindle stacked with almost 100 blu-ray disks; retrieving a RAW file from an older disk is a real pain in the bum!\\n\\nSo it was time to invest in a 8TB drive to backup all my data, which I could then place in a fireproof safe. I was very hesitant to get a SMR type drive as I've heard so much about their slow writing speeds. I was debating for several weeks whether or not to go for this drive given the price, or a bare Barracuda Pro drive which I could hot-plug into my computer. Yesterday, as I was browsing amazon, the price of this external drive dropped 25%. So without hesitation, I bought it. This is the cheapest 8TB you can get today!\\n\\n--- Out of the box ---\\n\\nThe first thing I checked were seek errors and rewritten sectors using Crystal Disk Info. Then ran some DST tests using SeaTools. The drive passed with flying colours (please note that with Seagate drives, Crystal Disk Info appears to report errors, in fact you only need to be concerned with the first 4 digits (on the left) of the RAW results and not the last 8 (on the right) which are hexadecimal values of how many times a drive was accessed. You can read this up online.\\n\\n--- Speed tests ---\\n\\nI initially plugged the drive into a USB 2.0 port and realised this as soon as I ran Crystal Disk Mark which was reporting transfer speeds of 42 MB\\/s. My ASUS A87-A motherboard has dedicated USB 3.0 ports so I immediately relocated the connection.\\n\\nFirst test, straight out of the box, gave me sequential 184.5 MB\\/s read and 142.5 MB\\/s write.\\n\\nI then read this thing about my motherboard having USB 3.0 boost, so tried it out (after installing older win 8.1 drivers) and sure enough, performance jumped to 210.8 read and 204.8 write. But, any queued and threaded tests were halved - which are more realistic tests given that I will be transferring hundreds of thousands of smaller files. So I uninstalled all the turbo boost (also probably one of the reasons they never produced drivers for windows 10).\\n\\nI then tested standard windows file transfers from my SSD to the Seagate. Writing a large 3Gb file from SSD to Seagate gave me 176 MB\\/s. Reading the large file produced 184 MB\\/s.\\n\\nI then transferred 10Gb of smaller files (realistic example) and this gave me 108 MB\\/s SSD to Seagate, and 176 MB\\/s back from Seagate to SSD (note that with USB 3.0 Boost (a feature of my Asus mobo) these file transfers dropped to around 70 MB\\/s).\\n\\nNow that might not be super speedy, but given that I need to backup files from my 2 bay NAS which has no space for a third drive, and only has USB 2.0, the max speed I will ever get is over 1Gbe network from NAS > PC > Seagate and that will be 105MB\\/s max. So the Seagate write speed of 108 MB\\/s is sufficient for the task. And given that it performed so well reading files at 184 MB\\/s, this drive is as ideal for my purpose!\\n\\n--- 3 year recovery option ---\\n\\nTo top this off, I followed the link to the registration page (link is on the Seagate drive) and I was taken to a page offering me a 3 year data recovery plan - should the drive stop working - for 14.99 USD (or \\u00a312.31) ! That's peanuts compared to what prices I've seen quoted in the past. This was a real cherry on the top and without hesitation I purchased the 3 year plan.\\n\\n--- Summary ---\\n\\nAll in all, this is a fantastic piece of kit (for the price) and would highly recommend as a secondary backup option (to a NAS) for photographers and videographers. I've attached screenshots of all the relevant speed tests.\\nRead more\",\"29\":\"This was purchased for use as additional drive for M1 Mac Min which has only 256G drive built in.\\n\\nIt worked as intended but became very warm even if it was doing nothing, just being connected.

I want to leave the review here too to hopefully save some people some money.\\n\\nI saw and read so many reviews of this KB before I took the plunge and bought one and honestly I do not know what all the fuss is about. I have seen the majority of these reviews saying that \\\"It's the best keyboard for productivity!\\\"... Erm, what?\\n\\nLook, it's not that this is a bad keyboard, far from it. I just can't understand why people are peeing in their pants over it. There is literally nothing special about it and it's WAAAAAYYYYYYY too expensive for what it ultimately is. You could find the exact same experience on something half the price or less. At the end of the day it's just a keyboard and nothing more. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE!\\n\\nSo typing on this thing is great... for short periods of time. It's your regular scissor switch, membrane, low profile affair and when you first start using it, it seems nice and quiet, especially when you have come from an awful Keycron K8 mechanical keyboard. However use this thing for more than 30 minutes without headphones on and you will notice that this thing is actually pretty loud and clicky. Not clicky like a blue switch mechanical keyboard but a different, worse clicky as it's one you don't notice until you do and then you can't not notice it and it grinds deep into your ears and brain and soul... I may be being overly harsh here but this thing is NOT silent.\\nThe other issue with typing is one which goes with any low profile board and that is after a while, the lack of travel in the keys mans that it feels like you are typing directly on the surface you have the board on, it feel like typing directly onto wood or concrete or razor blades. OK maybe not the last one but it's not nice.\\n\\nThis is not an ergo board so do not expect that. It's fairly wide and the keys are quite big so you aren't cramped on the board itself but there is nothing ergonomic about it. It's is VERY low profile and has barely any angle to it. Logitech have decided that you shouldn't be able to adjust the angle either so there are no adjustable feet. You'll either need to buy an accessory to lift the board or put up with it. In the version I bought you get a wrist rest however this causes me more pain than not using it so put it back in the box. It's nothing more than a piece of yoga mat on a bit of plastic. I mean it's not literally that but doesn't offer up an image of quality. DO NOT BUY THE VERSION WITH THE STUPID WRIST REST!\\n\\nThe board does have good connectivity which is no different to lots and lots of other cheaper keyboards out there. You can connect to 3 BT devices and you also get a dongle do you can connect via that. Connection for me is instant when switching between my work laptop and my PC which is something I haven't seen from any other board. I haven't noticed a slow down in re-connection when not using the board for a while either. The terrible Keychron mentioned earlier used to take a few seconds to wake up and then re-connect so this is a plus. I haven't tried connecting to a mac but I have seen mention that there can be issues with this but cannot confirm.\\n\\nBacklighting is pretty good. It's white and can be turned up, down and off. The keyboard will go dark when you move your hands away and will automatically turn the backlights off if there is enough ambient light in the room you are in. This saves the battery a bit of course. Lights will turn back on when it senses your hands over the board.\\n\\nBattery lasts about two weeks I think. That's actually pretty good with the amount I use the board. I have the back lights on medium and of course it's always connected to something via bluetooth. recharging takes about 4 hours and charges via USB C which is nice. I was expecting Micro USB like I have on my MX Master Mouse (V1).\\n\\nThe MX Master Mouse is maybe why this board is such a huge disappointment for me. The MX Master mouse is hands down amazing. It's lovely to hold, the correct weight, has nice, surprising and useful features and feels as high quality as it actually it. I have had that thing for two years, it's been dropped, thrown in bags with all kinds of other junk and never missed a beat. I think I have charged it three times in that time. It's solid, useful, well thought out and special.\\n\\nThe MX keys is none of those things. I look at it and it's just another keyboard there is nothing special about it. Yes it's heavy and made of some metal (I think) but it overwhelmingly feels fragile and average quality. I would not be comfortable being as carefree with this as I am with the mouse. I would NOT throw this in a bag and take to work because I think once you got there all of the keys would be gone.\\nSpeaking of the keys the more I use them the noisier they get , the loser they feel and the more I believe that I will start to see keycaps coming off. There are no special features on this board which set it apart from another and there certainly isn't anything to justify the price.\\n\\nI really can't and don't recommend this board at all. If it was \\u00a360 then yeah, great go for it but at \\u00a399 or \\u00a3109 if you get the stupid wrist rest version it's an utter rip off. You can go get any one of the generic knock off's on Amazon for \\u00a320 - \\u00a345 and have more or less the same experience.

I have given up a few hours in, after reading online that it really doesn't get much better.\\n\\nVisually and audibly, the game is decent. For the most part it looks and sounds like Star Wars and is perfectly acceptable.\\n\\nThe story started quite strongly but very quickly became tiring, incoherent and uninteresting.\\n\\nThe gameplay is the biggest issue, however.\\n\\nLightsaber combat is extremely basic and boring, with the weapon feeling like a baseball bat - unable to one-hit kill Stormtroopers, with no human dismemberment whatsoever. It doesn't feel like a powerful weapon and it isn't fun to use.\\n\\nUsing the Force is also basic and boring. The game puts not effort into letting you use the Force. You have at your disposal: Force Slow, Force Push, Force Pull, Force Jump. That's it.\\n\\n2003's Jedi Academy, in addition to the above 4 powers, also offered: Force Absorb, Force Heal, Force Protect, Jedi Mind Trick, Force Grip, Force Drain, Force Lightning and Force Rage.\\n\\nNotice how all of the fun, exciting and destructive powers are all omitted from Fallen Order?\\n\\nThe game does order a skill tree, to improve your skills and health etc, however, because the game is so bland and featureless, working your way through the skill tree doesn't really change your character much at all. Slightly more health, slightly more damage, slightly more stamina etc. The odd combo here and there but that is about it.\\n\\nThe controls are poor for the most part. I never felt in full control of my character. The game is essentially Tomb Raider\\/Uncharted with a Star Wars paint job, both handles worse than both of those franchises.\\n\\nThe platforming is dull and not suited to a Star Wars game. The backtracking is tedious and the whole game feels like no effort has been put into making it.\\n\\nI enjoy collectables in games, picking up an item and reading about its place in the game's world, reading about the lore and history etc. Tomb Raider and Uncharted do this very well.\\nOne of the first 'collectables' or thing's to 'explore' in Fallen Order was some shipping crates. The piece of text accompanying it explained that these shipping crates were used by that planet to ship goods. I'm not joking. Someone was paid actual money to design this and write this text. EA are a joke, really.\\n\\nAs a side note, the world is so un-interactable. The world feels dead, you can't destroy furniture and ornaments with your lightsaber, everything is just for show. Try and interact with the world and you can't. The game want's you to play a very specific way and not step out of the scripted path for a second, you might as well watch a let's play. You'll get the same enjoyment.\\n\\nDespite only costing \\u00a320, I still regret buying Fallen Order. Even if it was available for free on PS Plus one month, I still wouldn't recommend wasting your bandwidth downloading it.\\n\\nIt is a great example of everything wrong with modern big studio releases.\\nRead more\",\"76\":\"This is for you all who have a small desk. I have a small desk only 50cm depth and wanted this for my gaming setup, when I first installed the monitors it was terrible. They are 24 inch monitors x2, and because of it can fit up to 27 inch the arms at the back was sticking so far out that it hit the wall, which means I would have had my monitors protruding out about half way in the centre of the desk. So I instead decided to modify the stand by removing one of the arms bars leaving the bracket with 2 bars on one side and only one on the other side. Doing this fit them perfectly with still a little bit of room to play around with to adjust.

I've used numerous gaming headsets over the years, including the Audeze Penrose X, Astro A50 & B&O Portal in more recent times. The Nova Pro Wireless blows them all out of the water. With every headset I've owned there has always been drawbacks, but honestly I cannot find a single fault with this headset. Steelseries has been overdue an upgrade to their Arctis line-up & I suspect this particular headset has been years in the making.\\nStarting with the design aesthetic of the headset itself, it's very reminiscent of the B&O Portal (I believe it's the same designer) only they have improved upon it. The headband design associated with Steelseries has been significantly improved & is now perfect. The headset is extremely comfortable: lightweight, plush ear cups & top notch build quality. There really is nothing to fault. The base station is also top quality too. Note if you play on multiple consoles, buy the Xbox version since it also works on PS5, Switch & PC.\\n\\nOnto the sound, my god it's incredible. Crystal clear with zero distortion, bass that is impactful, right out of the box the audio is amazing. The default flat EQ is great, but you can customise via the base station. Spatial audio is extremely impressive. I'm using Dolby Atmos with my Xbox & audio is so well defined. Extremely immersive.\\nI could go on & on about how great this headset but to summarise, this headset is the new benchmark for gaming headsets. I really don't see how it can be beat. Everything about the Arctis Pro Wireless which came before it has been improved upon drastically. In Bluetooth mode (paired with a phone) the audio is equally impressive & can be used for everyday use. If you are serious into gaming & want a headset which is versatile, look no further.\\nHats off to Steelseries, the wait has been worth it. Finally I have the flawless gaming headset I have long since wanted. The manufacturer has left no stone unturned. These gaming headset companies (including Steelseries) have a habit of rehashing the same headset with a few new features to call it new. In this instance it appears Steelseries has almost gone back to the drawing board. I can see the feedback to this headset being unanimous & the review I've just wrote being typical of the reception. Honestly, it doesn't get any better than this headset. \\u00a3330 isn't cheap, but they're worth every penny in my view.\\nRead more\",\"84\":\"** UPDATE NOV 2020 **\\n\\nAfter 15 months of ownership and fewer than 30 power-on cycles, the drive began producing errors:\\n\\n05 000000000008 Reallocated Sectors Count\\nBB 000000000033 Reported Uncorrectable Errors\\nC5 000000000010 Current Pending Sector Count\\nC6 000000000010 Uncorrectable Sector Count\\n\\nI immediately ran SeaTools (several times, with computer reboots in between) but it failed on all occasions:\\n\\nSeaTools Test Code: E1D36CEE\\nSMART - Started 14\\/10\\/2020 20:53:35\\nSMART - Pass 14\\/10\\/2020 20:53:41\\nShort DST - Started 14\\/10\\/2020 21:29:56\\nShort DST - FAIL 14\\/10\\/2020 21:30:09\\nFix All Long - Started 14\\/10\\/2020 21:31:04\\nFix All Long - Started 14\\/10\\/2020 22:11:36\\nFix All Long - FAIL 15\\/10\\/2020 13:36:47\\nFAIL\\n\\nSo I initiated an Amazon return as the drive is still under warranty.

So I ran both short DST and long generic, and both passed!\\n\\nSeaTools Test Code: E1D36CEE\\nSMART - Started 28\\/10\\/2020 11:07:46\\nSMART - Pass 28\\/10\\/2020 11:07:52\\nShort DST - Started 28\\/10\\/2020 11:27:46\\nShort DST - Pass 28\\/10\\/2020 11:28:55\\nLong Generic - Started 28\\/10\\/2020 11:29:06\\nLong Generic - Pass 29\\/10\\/2020 07:31:07\\n\\nI concluded there was no point in returning the drive if it is no longer reporting errors: I'll just be sending it to a repair shop only for it to be sent back with a clean bill of health. It hasn't given me any problems for the last month. I've copied the 5TB of files back onto it, without any issues. As I paid for the 3 year recovery plan when purchasing the drive, I'm now just crossing my fingers. This does not inspire huge amounts of confidence, but I also understand some errors can occur when dealing with such large amounts of data.\\n\\nI will keep you posted if things change. Rating it down from 5 star to 4 stars.\\n\\n** ORIGINAL REVIEW **\\n\\nReceived this drive today, thought I would provide some speed test results whilst I'm running SeaTools in the background, a long test which will take just under 20 hours for this 8TB drive!\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nI was looking to backup almost 4TB of photos from my NAS which is running out of space and needs an upgrade soon. I'm a hobbyist photographer fed up burning archival blurays in chunks of 25Gb and then having to use an outdated tool (Octopus DVD indexer) to catalogue which files are on which disks. I have a spindle stacked with almost 100 blu-ray disks; retrieving a RAW file from an older disk is a real pain in the bum!\\n\\nSo it was time to invest in a 8TB drive to backup all my data, which I could then place in a fireproof safe. I was very hesitant to get a SMR type drive as I've heard so much about their slow writing speeds. I was debating for several weeks whether or not to go for this drive given the price, or a bare Barracuda Pro drive which I could hot-plug into my computer. Yesterday, as I was browsing amazon, the price of this external drive dropped 25%. So without hesitation, I bought it. This is the cheapest 8TB you can get today!\\n\\n--- Out of the box ---\\n\\nThe first thing I checked were seek errors and rewritten sectors using Crystal Disk Info. Then ran some DST tests using SeaTools. The drive passed with flying colours (please note that with Seagate drives, Crystal Disk Info appears to report errors, in fact you only need to be concerned with the first 4 digits (on the left) of the RAW results and not the last 8 (on the right) which are hexadecimal values of how many times a drive was accessed. You can read this up online.\\n\\n--- Speed tests ---\\n\\nI initially plugged the drive into a USB 2.0 port and realised this as soon as I ran Crystal Disk Mark which was reporting transfer speeds of 42 MB\\/s. My ASUS A87-A motherboard has dedicated USB 3.0 ports so I immediately relocated the connection.\\n\\nFirst test, straight out of the box, gave me sequential 184.5 MB\\/s read and 142.5 MB\\/s write.\\n\\nI then read this thing about my motherboard having USB 3.0 boost, so tried it out (after installing older win 8.1 drivers) and sure enough, performance jumped to 210.8 read and 204.8 write. But, any queued and threaded tests were halved - which are more realistic tests given that I will be transferring hundreds of thousands of smaller files. So I uninstalled all the turbo boost (also probably one of the reasons they never produced drivers for windows 10).\\n\\nI then tested standard windows file transfers from my SSD to the Seagate. Writing a large 3Gb file from SSD to Seagate gave me 176 MB\\/s. Reading the large file produced 184 MB\\/s.\\n\\nI then transferred 10Gb of smaller files (realistic example) and this gave me 108 MB\\/s SSD to Seagate, and 176 MB\\/s back from Seagate to SSD (note that with USB 3.0 Boost (a feature of my Asus mobo) these file transfers dropped to around 70 MB\\/s).\\n\\nNow that might not be super speedy, but given that I need to backup files from my 2 bay NAS which has no space for a third drive, and only has USB 2.0, the max speed I will ever get is over 1Gbe network from NAS > PC > Seagate and that will be 105MB\\/s max. So the Seagate write speed of 108 MB\\/s is sufficient for the task. And given that it performed so well reading files at 184 MB\\/s, this drive is as ideal for my purpose!\\n\\n--- 3 year recovery option ---\\n\\nTo top this off, I followed the link to the registration page (link is on the Seagate drive) and I was taken to a page offering me a 3 year data recovery plan - should the drive stop working - for 14.99 USD (or \\u00a312.31) ! That's peanuts compared to what prices I've seen quoted in the past. This was a real cherry on the top and without hesitation I purchased the 3 year plan.\\n\\n--- Summary ---\\n\\nAll in all, this is a fantastic piece of kit (for the price) and would highly recommend as a secondary backup option (to a NAS) for photographers and videographers. I've attached screenshots of all the relevant speed tests.\\nRead more\",\"85\":\"The biggest problems with laptops are battery life, heat and speed.\\n\\nThis has all 3 covered and then some. Without a fan.\\n\\nIt lives up to the hype reviewers are giving it, and as an everyday laptop, and the cheapest base model, it's a leap ahead of laptops from the likes of Intel. Previously the Air has been known to be hampered on the above problems but all of that has gone away with Apple Silicon.\\n\\nDon't let the 8GB Ram fool you, with the M1 Chip memory is handled differently, and although it's shared with the GPU (7 core in this model), the efficiency of apps means you can churn through multiple tasks that can be compared with machines several times the cost. As of the posting of this review, there's lots of apps that aren't optimised for M1, but still run well under \\\"Rosetta 2\\\", which translates apps designed for Intel. iPhone & iPad apps also run (though many developers have opted out), which is janky, but works in a pinch. This is early days of Mac OS Big Sur, and the transition has been surprisingly smooth. It's actually hard to adjust from laptops that slow down and drain battery with just a couple of apps open.\\n\\nThis sounds like an ad, but if you're not convinced, go try this in an Apple Store, the best way to explain it is to put a keyboard on an iPad, keeping its snappiness, memory efficiency and battery savings. The only drawback is the ports, but those used to the dongle life won't mind for the benefits.\\n\\nYes there are cheaper laptops, but this is an exceptional all-rounder. If you're on the fence, push the button, you won't regret it.\\nRead more\",\"86\":\"Great product, but one thing I find really annoying, maybe considering return.\\n\\nIf you want to charge something at 45w ( I got samsung s8 tablet) you can't have anything plugged in, even just small USB-C to USB-A adapter dongle next to it.\\nIt will cap 45W port to like 15-20W, even without charging anything else at the moment\",\"87\":\"Bought this hub to connect up computer and network storage as I'd run out of ports on the broadband router.\\nI was very disappointed to find that despite all of my devices having Gigabit Ethernet ports this hub throttled everything to 100mbit.

A single device (so nothing else connected to cause throttling) connected to the hub had a maximum transfer rate of ~12MB\\/s which is just under the maximum rate for 100mbit. The same device connected directly to the router runs 4 times faster.

Printing from different devices was simple and intuitive and at first everything looked great. Unfortunately the versatility of this printer is very low. I was able to print documents to standard A4 with no problems at all. When trying to print on slightly thicker paper, for example sticky backed paper for labels, the ink would smudge at the top and bottom of the page.\\n\\nI also tried printing on A4 photo paper but the printer leaves indentation marks on the paper itself. I also had to change the paper settings on the printer as the app would error saying the print and the paper settings didn't match. On other printers I've had, the settings come across from the application I'm using straight to the printer so never had this problem before.\\n\\nNot great, so spoke to Epson support and they said that only the Epson paper was guaranteed to work and that I should try different paper types until I find one that works. They also mentioned label paper isn't supported.\\n\\nPreviously I had an 8 year old cannon printer which worked flawlessly on all paper that I threw at it. So was surprised how poor this printer performed.\\n\\nSpoke to Amazon support and they had no problem setting up a return for me, I needed to use the printer to print the return label, which as expected, smudged.\\n\\nMay be a good machine for basic printing, especially if you'd rather print from a phone than a PC, but anything more involved, I'd look at alternatives.\\nRead more\",\"91\":\"Having had a 2019 other-branded cheap thing for the last couple of years, I was starting to find the lack of memory was struggling.

Everything is stored in the cloud, the device itself is just the more or less stupid endpoint to display web based content and applications. No need for huge amounts of storage, no need for fast, modern CPUs, everything is as basic as it gets. Disposable. If I lose my chromebook, do I bother? I don't think so. I will just get me a cheap new chromebook and continue where I left off.\\n\\nSo, what do I expect from a chromebook?\\nCheap convenience. Useful battery life. A good enough display that my eyes don't hurt. Good enough keyboard and trackpad to do substantial work. Good enough sound to enjoy the odd YouTube\\/Netflix. Maybe a touch screen, especially when you consider to use your chromebook with Android apps.\\n\\nI used to have an Acer 13\\\" chromebook since 2015. Even though it only had 2 GB RAM and 16 GB storage, it was good enough. Until, well, until the summer of 2021, when ChromeOS really, really wanted to get more than 2GB RAM and the lack of RAM turned it into a sluggish, useless paperweight.

There is no annoying fan and everything is as convenient as it can be.\\n\\nBuild quality isn't that much. It's - again - perfectly adequate.
